# Neuromusuloskeletal-Data-Analysis-1
* This is a course project created in MATLAB. It analyzes and extracts data gained from the baseline activity of a cockroach leg, using varying sizes of electrodes and distances between referencing and recording electrodes. Then extracting the:
  * Firing rate vs electrode spacing and size
  * Average waveform vs electrode spacing and size
  * Waveform amplitude vs electrode spacing and size
  * Waveform amplitude distribution for each recording
  * SNR vs electrode size

* Last updated on: 22nd Jan 2025, as Lab 1 for the course BIOEN 566 - Neural Engineering Lab.

* This program was written in MATLAB. To run, import files to local system and run on MATLAB IDE or preferred text editor which can run MATLAB files (Recommended: VSCode).
